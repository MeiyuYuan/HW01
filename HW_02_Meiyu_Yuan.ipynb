    "    1. For the Monte Hall problem and Markovian ChatBot code, Chatbot was able to quickly provide explanatory answers to each of the questions I asked in less than 20 seconds and was able to analyze the code's strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement. ChatBot helped me to understand the logic of the code and directly providing clean code that simulated the Monte Hall problem to optimize the code's logic and increase the efficiency of code execution. For Markovian ChatBot code, ChatBot explains complex data structures and analyzes optimizations (binary syntactic dependencies) that different extensions have. With ChatBot's explanations of data and code structures, I was able to quickly understand how to build a (character-specific) Markov chain model using dictionaries and understand unintelligible statements in the code.\n",

Solving problems by interacting with ChatBot is not frustrating or unhelpful, as in most cases ChatBot is able to quickly analyze the problem and provide clear explanations, suggestions and improvements. However, it cannot be ruled out that in individual complex problems, ChatBot has difficulty in understanding the problem directly and provides answers that do not meet expectations. In such cases, it is only necessary to guide ChatBot to the expected answer through precise wording or further detailed questioning.\n",

    "    3. In summary, as a tool to help me understand the code ChatBots is very efficient and helpful, in terms of code learning it can help me improve my learning efficiency by 60-70%. When it comes to solving errors in coding, it quickly helps me fix code errors and explains the logic and principles. Whether it's a complex or simple programming problem, it helps me grasp the concepts and how to use the code. However, in general the first answers provided by ChatBots were relatively concise or flexible code, and when I wanted to use a particular piece of code I needed to give it several hints/detailed and specific further descriptions. In individual problems with inaccurate descriptions, ChatBots occasionally misinterpreted what I meant or provided other examples of relevant code.\n",
